    'We are focused on ending mental health stigma, and creating a comfortable environment for open conversations about mental health issues. As an organization, we have come to understand the importance of stories in challenging inbred notions about mental health issues, especially when the stories come from those with lived experience. This is what our campaigns revolve around and we can already see the change in attitude that has occurred as a result of this.',
